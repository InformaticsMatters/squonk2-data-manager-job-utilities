   :alt: PyPI package (latest)

A Python 2/3 package that simplifies the generation of *events* and *cost*
lines written to the Job's stdout stream.

The following utilities are available: -

- ``DmLog.emit_event()``
- ``DmLog.emit_cost()``

Installation (Python)
=====================

The Job utilities are published on `PyPI`_ and can be installed from
there::

    pip install im-data-manager-job-utilities

Once installed you can use the available classes::

    >>> from dm_job_utilities.dm_log import DmLog
    >>> DmLog.emit_event('Hello World!')
    2022-02-03T16:39:27+00:00 # INFO -EVENT- Hello World!
    >>> from decimal import Decimal
    >>> DmLog.emit_cost(Decimal('5.7'))
    2022-02-03T16:40:16+00:00 # INFO -COST- 5.7 1


Costs are *total* by default but can be issued as an incremental value::

    >>> DmLog.emit_cost(Decimal('0.5'), incremental=True)
    2022-02-03T16:40:16+00:00 # INFO -COST- +0.5 2


The final value on each cost line is a unique sequence number. This value
is typically an integer that increments with each line. It is required and
is used by the Data Manager to avoid duplicating costs.
